<h1>Using the Assembly Service Command-Line Client</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The DOE KBase features an Assembly Service with tools that allow users to submit a variety of sequence datasets to be processed, assembled, and analyzed.  This tutorial will introduce you to the current capabilities of the service as well as give some command-line recipes.</p>

<p>Currently at an early phase, the Assembly Service has the following computation capabilities capabilities:
- Velvet assembly
- Kiki assembly
- BWA alignment</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>-Python easy_install module</p>

<h3>Prepackaged Installation in Unix</h3>

<p>The Assembly Service Client uses Python's Easy Install module to manage and install dependencies.  To install, first download the latest .egg package from the <a href="http://kbase.us/index.php/developers/downloads/">KBase Downloads page</a>.  To install:</p>

<p><code>sudo easy_install ar_client-&lt;VERSION&gt;.egg</code></p>

<h2>Running the Service</h2>

<p>We will walk through building a command-line recipe depending on desired options.  First, running an assemblies is performed via the <code>run</code> subcommand:</p>

<p><code>arast run ...</code></p>

<h3>Sequence Data</h3>

<p>We can submit data in multiple fashions:</p>

<h4>Separate files: <code>-f</code></h4>

<p>`arast run -f SEQUENCE<em>1.fa SEQUENCE</em>2.fa ...</p>

<h4>Whole directories</h4>

<p><code>arast run -d /path/to/sequences/ ...</code></p>

<h4>Previously submitted datasets</h4>

<p>`arast run --data DATAID ...</p>
