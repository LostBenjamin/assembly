# Using the Assembly Service Command-Line

## Introduction 

The Assembly Service is a web-based environment that allows users to
submit sequence datasets to be processed, assembled, and analyzed. 
This tutorial will introduce you to the current capabilities of the
service as well as give some command-line recipes. You will learn how
to upload a set of read files, assemble them, inspect the results, and
get the best assembly for your downstream analysis. 

The default pipeline tends to perform well in our judgment, but you
are encouraged to experiment with alternative assemblers,
preprocessing tools and parameter settings. Our service currently
supports over 20 assemblers and tools, and its modular design allows
for straightforward extension as sequencing technologies and analysis
tools evolve. We have also built a powerful pipeline engine that
allows you to mix and match approaches and evaluate a variety of
customized pipelines on your datasets. 

We will start with a very simple example. We will then step through
the commands and options. Since a thorough assembly on a microbial
genome can take hours, we will be using a partial dataset in the early
examples. In the final set of examples, we will work with some real
data. This tutorial will focus on microbial assembly, although some of
the modules included in the service supports assembly of
low-complexity metagenomes.
